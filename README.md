[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/uni-projects-2021/Team%20project/_apis/build/status/io-ytsejam.dean-meeting-reservations?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/uni-projects-2021/Team%20project/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=main)

This a project which allows students and guests book appointments with dean and university workers. 
Each authorized user has a dashboard with abbility to see upcomming meetings, meeting requests and their information (name, surname, office hours)
Every user has an ability to send appointment requests to authorized users, which are grouped by department they are werking in

I did around 80% of all frontend programming, which are registration and log-in pages, dashboard page, nav bar and landing page.

I used ReactJs with Typescript to achieve the final result.
